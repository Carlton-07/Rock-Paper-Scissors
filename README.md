A simple rock,paper,scissors game with the computer in which rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock. 
    The computer makes a random choice and the user inputs his/her choice and then the game is played.

    If the answer is yes, the game is played again but if it is no then it prints a message and the loop ends.
